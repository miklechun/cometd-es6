# cometd-es6

A implementation of the [CometD](https://github.com/cometd/cometd) client library as an ES6 module.

This library does not include the Dojo or jQuery plugins, and as such, the long-poll and JSONP transports don't work yet. See [#1](https://github.com/seansfkelley/cometd-es6/issues/1) for more.

## Development

For the time being, I plan to track the official CometD implementation. Please send suggestions and bug reports their way unless they are obviously related to this port.
